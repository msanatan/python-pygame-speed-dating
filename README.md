## Files

Due to the circumstances of how the first class went, content for class tutors
and students are held in the same repo. `python-refresh.md` is solely for
tutors. The following files are meant for students:

1. `functions-ifs-practice.md`
2. `loops.md`
3. `data-structures.md`
4. `pygame.md`

More structure would be put in place for this repo and and student content
soon...
